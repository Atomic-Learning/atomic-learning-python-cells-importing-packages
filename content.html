<h2>Modules from the Python Standard Library</h2>

The way interactive Python cells are configured in the Atomic Learning Platform, modules from the Python Standard Library are available for immediate use without any additional setup. 

<py-cell>import math

print(math.sqrt(16))</py-cell>

<h2>Packages from Outside the Standard Library</h2>

Packages that are not part of the Python Standard Library need to be specified in the metadata of the content item to be available for use in Python cells. This is done by listing the package names under the "python_packages" key in the metadata file. For instance, in the metadata of this content item, the packages <code>numpy</code> and <code>pandas</code> are listed. The end of the metadata file looks like this:

<pre><code language="json">⋮
    "python_packages": [
        "numpy",
        "pandas"
    ]
}</code></pre>

You can see the full metadata file <a href="https://github.com/Atomic-Learning/atomic-learning-python-cells-importing-packages/blob/main/metadata.json" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. This allows for the packages to imported and used directly in the Python cells, as shown below:

<py-cell>import numpy as np
array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print("Numpy array:", array)
</py-cell>
